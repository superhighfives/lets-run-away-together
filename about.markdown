# Hello, I'm Charlie.

I am a [designer](http://charliegleason.com), [musician](http://wearebrightly.com) and [pretend photographer](http://flickr.com/superhighfives). I used to be in Melbourne[^1], and now I am in London. I really like music, so I write about it.

If you'd like to be considered for **Let's Run Away Together**, you[^2] should [email me](mailto:hi@charliegleason.com) and say hi. Soundcloud links are preferable, but I'm pretty flexible. If you have press photos you'd like me to check out, you can send them too.

If you have any feedback, suggestions, features, freebies, soup recipes, or if you know where my birth parents are, [you should also get in touch](mailto:hi@charliegleason.com).

[^1]: It's pretty great.
[^2]: As are you.
