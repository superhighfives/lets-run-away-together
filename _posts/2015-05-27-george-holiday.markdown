When **George** (stylised as **george**) appeared out of nowhere in 2000 my friends and I were pretty obsessed. We went and watched them do an instore at a local Borders, back when Borders was an actual thing and people read actual physical books.

I never totally bought the mid-90's hippy vibe on some of their other tracks, but unlike Borders, **Holiday** stands the test of time.
