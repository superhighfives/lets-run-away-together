**The Tallest Man On Earth**, monkier of Swedish troubadour Kristian Matsson, won my heart with 2010's The Wild Hunt and 2013's There's No Leaving Now.

The new single **Dark Bird Is Home**, [taken from the forthcoming record][official-site] of the same name, explores the final moments of a dying man and has me incredibly excited for the new material.

> Oh, fuck”
