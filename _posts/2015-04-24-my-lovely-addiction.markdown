> “Addiction, it seems, is a patient ghost who waits and watches until you’re comfortable in the arms of a new love, only to reach out and brush a finger along the back of your neck, whispering, ‘I’m still here.’ And suddenly there I am, gravel puncturing the skin of my knees, naked on the street begging one lover not to leave while emptying my bank account to fly cross-country to bump into another.”
