A discordant opening, **To Disappear** floats near the ether, just out of reach. Highlighted thoughout is a desperate flickering negative spaceâ€”it finds lines and rhythms and seems to draw a path, but just as you think you've got it figured out, it slides away again. There's a stunning array of sounds on offer, tied together by a compelling vocal melody.

Well worth a listen, and a watch (the video, from Japanese animator densuke28, follows a time-travelling future ape that I've nicknamed Gary), if not just because it has one of my favourite band names of the year thus far.

It is taken from the debut album, [The Watercolors](http://kingdeluxe.ca/the-watercolors) via [King Deluxe](http://kingdeluxe.ca/).
