Full disclosure, I know these guys. They're really great. But even if they were jerks I'd still write about their music because it's _so good_.

Fortunately, they're really great.

**Soldiers** has a maturity that belies the relative newness of the group, and it's clear **Swim Season** have really found their feet. It's taken from their new EP, Cascades, [which you can pre-order](https://swimseason.bandcamp.com/album/cascades) and it makes me a tiny bit sad that summer is over in England.
