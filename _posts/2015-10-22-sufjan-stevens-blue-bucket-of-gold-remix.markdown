And it's really good.

Nothing like an email from [Asthmatic Kitty Records](http://asthmatickitty.com/) to break me from the reverie of Thursday afternoon. Especially when it involves a remix of **Blue Bucket of Gold**.

> Sufjan has released a remix of "Blue Bucket of Gold" from his album Carrie & Lowell. Featuring members of Stevens’ touring band, and recorded by Tucker Martine in Portland, Oregon and at Stevens’ studio in Brooklyn, the remix is an interpretation of the band’s live version of the song.

I saw him at Royal Festival Hall in London, and I was floored by how different and electronically driven his interpretations of the songs from **Carrie & Lowell** were. At the time I was gutted it would probably be the only time I'd hear those versions, but clearly I was wrong.
