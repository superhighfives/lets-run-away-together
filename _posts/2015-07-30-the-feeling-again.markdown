> “...it took a brilliant song by a brilliant artist like Brendan to show me I still have all my superpowers.” — Darren Hayes

Filmed throughout New York City, this deeply personal new single from his latest EP [Thought I'd Cry For You Forever][thought-id-cry] is as polished as it is raw. A stunning 4 minutes of music.
