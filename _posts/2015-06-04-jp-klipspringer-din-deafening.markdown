Since the release of [Bury Me][bury-me] (not be confused with the **30 Seconds To Mars** track) I've been a huge fan of Jack's. We played a show together in London last year and he fills a room as much with a single guitar as he does with a full band.

His new record, [Din Deafening][din-deafening] is must listen stuff. Glorious indie pop, in part mastered by **Andrei Eremin**, and well worth a listen.
