I remember, when I was a kid, how much joy video games brought me. My friends and I would huddle together next to the playground at lunch and pour over manuals for Starfox and Mario, desperate to get home and fire up the Super Nintendo. Recess was a brief respite from the heavy molasses that time was dragged through.

[Ori And The Blind Forest][ori] reminds me of that feeling, of that joy. It's a stunning work of art, a playful adventure game and a sweet-but-never-sacchrine morality tale.
