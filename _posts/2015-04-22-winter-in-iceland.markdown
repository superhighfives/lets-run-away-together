On the 29th of May, 2008, [a hot spring appeared in Hveragerði][hveragerdi] following an earthquake. During winter it cuts a line through the icy mountain range, and during Christmas 2014 we hiked alongside it to swim in the hot water high above the ocean.

It was awesome.

The woolen beardcap is by [Vík Prjónsdóttir][vik-prjonsdottir], one of my favourite designers, who use Icelandic wool in all their creations. I could not recommend them, and the beardcap, more highly.

Especially when you're in wintery Iceland.
