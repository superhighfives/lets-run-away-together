> American Girl started as a joke when I was watching old Kobe Bryant highlights and Estelle's "American Boy" was the soundtrack. I really wanted to make a stripped back #emotional version that would play on its really great melodic structure. I reached out to my lovely friend Wafia to sing a duet with me & mustered enough courage to jump on the first verse. I'm very proud of this song. I hope you enjoy it.

Downtempo R&B joy.
